VRWorld Toolkit is a Unity Editor extension made to make VRChat world creation more accessible and lower the entry-level to make a good performing world. Currently, the tool is aimed only at people making VRChat worlds and will only work with the VRCSDK imported, but this might change in the future.

To report problems, you can either contact me on discord at 1.#0001 or create a new issue. Feel free also to join my [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FCm28DM)!

### Current features

1. **World Debugger**

Goes through your scene and checks for common issues, and makes suggestions on what to improve. Includes over 70 different tips, warnings, errors, and general messages currently!

2. **Disable On Build**

Adds a new Tag that disabled GameObjects on world upload. The most significant use case is using this for trigger-based occlusion.

3. **Post Processing setup**

Automatically import and setup a simple starter Post Processing setup to edit further.

4. **Custom Editors**

Adds more features to the pre-existing VRChat components to make them easier to use and provide quality of life improvements. If not needed, they can also be easily disabled.

5. **Useful Links**

Quick access to download latest SDK versions and other useful links that are often needed when working on worlds.

**Disclaimer:** This extension is still a work in progress. Even though I try to test it thoroughly, things can break. *Remember to make backups of your projects and use this at your own risk!*
